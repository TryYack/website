          <p>You have the right to request that Teachfolk restricts the processing of your&nbsp;<em>personal Information or Personal Data</em> under certain conditions. For example, if you contest the accuracy of the&nbsp;<em>personal Information or Personal Data</em>, the processing may be restricted for a period enabling Teachfolk to verify the accuracy of the&nbsp;<em>personal Information or Personal Data</em> or if Teachfolk no longer needs the&nbsp;<em>personal Information or Personal Data</em> for the purposes of the processing but you require the PII for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.</p>
          <p>You have the right to have your&nbsp;<em>personal Information or Personal Data</em> deleted without undue delay and Teachfolk is obliged to delete your&nbsp;<em>personal Information or Personal Data</em> without undue delay if, for example, the&nbsp;<em>personal Information or Personal Data</em> is no longer necessary in relation to the purpose for which it was collected or otherwise processed. Please note that Teachfolk is not obliged to delete the&nbsp;<em>personal Information or Personal Data&nbsp;</em> if Teachfolk can show that the processing is necessary, for example, for the establishment, exercise, or defense of a legal claim.</p>

If we have already provided your information to a third party (such as a credit card processing partner) before you changed your preferences or updated your information, you may have to change your preferences directly with that third party.</p>
          <p>You have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to Teachfolk’s processing of your&nbsp;<em>personal Information or Personal Data</em> if the processing is based on, for example, legitimate interests. If you object to such processing, Teachfolk will no longer be entitled to process your&nbsp;<em>personal Information or Personal Data</em> based on such legal basis, unless Teachfolk can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which overrides your interests, rights, and freedom or if it is conducted for the establishment, exercise, or defense of a legal claim.</p>
          <p>You have, under certain conditions, the right to receive the&nbsp;<em>personal Information or Personal Data</em> concerning you and which you have provided to Teachfolk, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit such&nbsp;<em>personal Information or Personal Data</em> to another data controller without Teachfolk trying to prevent this, where Teachfolk’s processing of your&nbsp;<em>personal Information or Personal Data</em> is based on a contract or consent and the processing is carried out by automated means. In such case you have the right to request that the&nbsp;<em>personal Information or Personal Data&nbsp;</em>shall be transmitted from Teachfolk directly to another data controller, where technically feasible.</p>
          <p>You also have the right to withdraw your consent, if applicable. If you withdraw your consent, please note that this does not affect the lawfulness of the processing based on your consent before its withdrawal and that Teachfolk may, under certain circumstances, have another legal ground for the processing and therefore may be entitled to continue the processing.</p>
          <p>If you would like to exercise your rights, you may contact us on the contact details provided at the bottom of this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <p>If you are unhappy with our processing of your&nbsp;<em>personal Information or Personal Data&nbsp;</em>or of an alleged infringement of the General Data Protection Regulation or other applicable data privacy laws, you may lodge a complaint with a competent supervisory authority, for example in the country of your habitual residence or place of work.</p>
